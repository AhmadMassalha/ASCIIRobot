4/March/22:
anims: anims consists of all the animation texts list
1.player anims list:
-player_walk

in main we import pygame, we have the init things and also
a while TRUE loop that updates everything, there we call the background function
and after that we call every thing we want to be updated every tick,
we have player_move and playerStrech methods that are called from the keysAction method
which is a method that handles the pressed keys input and also the key events (key up /down)
using if statements we can call the methods according to what keys are being pressed.

the robot is a collection of symbols in a text, the text itself and the animations is saved in
anims files, the animation starts when the function player_move is triggered,this function takes a key
as a parameter which is the pressed key, this function is always being updated (while a key is pressed)
so to add delay to it, I did ...get_ticks() % delay == 0, so this function calls the animation function
which is also delay using a different idea (same principle using ticks) but then the string is altered and
the frames of the animation start to go and that's done by changing the var: strToRenderWalk.

strech uses a changing of the "font size" from the function render_multi_line()

5/March/22:
added list and queue data structures, the queue is going to be used for the dialoge typewriter.
added the method dialogue manager, but not fully implemented, has some problems that need solving

7/March/22:
worked on dialouges, work fine but there's a problem with delays (try changing the modolo in the delay counter)

16/march/22:
changed the dialogue system to use threads instead, planing to make a good thread pool.
added arrow
